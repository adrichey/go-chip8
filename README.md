# Overview
This is a quick and dirty Chip8 emulator written in Go to further my knowledge on emulation.

## Special Thanks
- Austin Morlan for his excellent write-up: [article](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/)
- Tim Franssen for his collection of test ROMs: [repo](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)
- Zophar's Domain for Pong which is now in the public domain: [website](https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html) | [mirror](https://archive.org/details/Chip-8RomsThatAreInThePublicDomain)

## TODO
- Write up instructions on how to get the emulator up and running locally
- Implement sound functionality
- Implement 5x33 properly to handle BCDs - Every test I have tried fails
